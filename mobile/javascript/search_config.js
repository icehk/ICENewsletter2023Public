In line                            with the Government’s social distancing measures, most of our events were                            held in a virtual format. An unexpected yet encouraging outcome was that                            the total number of participants in the events reached over 8,700 persons,                            with a significant number of participants from overseas. In achieving this, I                            am most grateful for the support of the members of the HKA Committee,                            the Graduates \& Students (G\&S) Division, and the Regional Support Team                            (RST).         4","ICE Breaker 2023                                                  Messages     ICE HKA Chairperson’s message 2022-2023  Some notable planned events, such as the annual dinner, overseas delegations, networking, and civil       engineering outreach were, unfortunately, cancelled or deferred due to the Covid-19 pandemic. With       the stabilisation of the pandemic, I trust that we could soon resume our normal business and some of the       above could be brought back to our agenda in the Year of the Rabbit 2023.       With more than 7,800 members in Hong Kong having Members and Fellows making up over 70% of       the membership, we strive to support ICE members throughout their careers, from the young generation       to industry experts across the fields of civil engineering. To connect with our members, we have set up       Facebook and LinkedIn pages to report our activities, promote upcoming events, share event photos, and       provide a platform for discussion and enhancing communication.         Moving forward in 2023, we will continue to lead the discussions around infrastructure and the built       environment by holding annual conference and forums, and arranging meetings and visits to keep       our members abreast of the latest developments in the professional field, and providing training for       young civil engineers to attain professional qualifications. We will also promote and expand the public       perception of the role, duties, and achievements of civil/infrastructure engineers through outreach       activities.        In response to the imminent threat of global climate change, our focus this year will continue to be       promoting sustainability (well-being and safety) and carbon neutrality in the delivery of infrastructure       projects, which follows the “Climate Challenge” theme and 5-year strategy put forward by the recent       ICE Presidents (decarbonising, productivity improvement, delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals       (SDGs), etc.) starting from 2020.       According to ICE Royal Charter, we have to act together urgently to address this primary existential       threat, and make good use and wise moves in the coming decades to avoid catastrophic impacts across       the planet.         Join us to shape the world and improve lives in the midst of climate change!

The reassuring part is that, as a result of                            our joint efforts against the pandemic we have become more resilient                            and better prepared for future challenges.  We have also become more                            appreciative of the need for a stable environment for orderly planning and                            sustaining our development.                             Civil engineers continue to take the lead to meet the unremitting                            demand for land, housing, medical, road and railway networks and                            many infrastructure projects, with a very substantial annual commitment                            of construction expenditure at HK$300 billion level, public and private                            sectors combined, for the coming years.  Responding to the Chief                            Executive’s advocacy for “enhancing quantity, speed, efficiency and                            quality”, we have to work smarter, not merely harder, to increase our                            capacity and capability and to revolutionize our industry towards high                            productivity construction.  It is against this backdrop that I am pleased to                            share with our readers the focus and priorities of the construction industry                            in Hong Kong for the coming years.                             The timely implementation of Building Information Modelling (BIM),                            initially on public works projects and now across all sectors, has been                            the key to digitalization of information, and in turn, integration of                            design, construction and facilities management.  Modular Integrated                            Construction (MiC), Multi-trade Integrated MEP (MiMEP), Digital Works                            Supervision System (DWSS) and Common Data Environment (CDE) are                            cornerstone achievements signifying the move towards High Productivity                            Construction (HPC).  To enhance overall management of the Capital                            Works Programme, we are also implementing the Integrated Capital                            Works Platform (iCWP) in phases to collect and consolidate data from                            DWSS and other digital systems.  The first phase of iCWP was launched in                            August 2022.         6","ICE Breaker 2023                                                  Messages          HPC enables labour intensive construction activities to be transferred to the factory, so as to reduce       on-site labours thus uplifting the on-site productivity and enhancing performance on works quality, site       safety and environmental sustainability.  The three major principles of HPC are (i) off-site prefabrication,       (ii) multi-trade integration and modular maximization as well as (iii) plug and play.  MiC and MiMEP       are the two best examples.  In carrying forward the momentum, our emphasis will move beyond       individual projects to full-scale application at industry level.  Government will continue to work       with industry stakeholders to set up a healthy Ecosystem for HPC, through devising accreditation       systems, strengthening the supply chain, streamlining approval processes, and introducing advanced       technologies for quality assurance and production tracking.  With cross border transport and       communication resuming, we will seize further opportunities for cooperation with the Greater Bay Area       (GBA) authorities on technology transfer, off-site fabrication and logistical arrangements.        While the wide adoption of innovative technologies and new construction methods has brought about       changes and benefits to project delivery, we are mindful of the need for nurturing and facilitating the       application of Research and Development.  A Task Force on Applied R\&D in public works projects has       been established to co-ordinate efforts in piloting applied R\&D and serve as a platform to facilitate the       exchanges between the academia and the industry.  Some of the pilot projects, adopting high impact       applied R\&D items such as S690 high strength steel, vibration-resistant concrete lining, etc., have       demonstrated considerable benefits in respect of cost, time, productivity and safety.        Well-being and safety of our workforce is always our top priority.  Over the years we have achieved       modest success in curbing the number of accidents on site, but it is so saddening to see fatal accidents       happening when they could well have been avoided.  It is high time for the whole industry to put our       act together to revamp our safety culture and nurture a community that cares for all and puts workers’       lives first.  We must pay particular attention to design for safety, identify risks early, provide a safe       working environment and better co-ordinate our work.  Digitalisation and HPC come as a timely help.       It is now a mandatory requirement for public works projects with value above $30M to implement the       Smart Site Safety System (SSSS), where smart safety devices, together with a centralised management       platform, are installed for raising safety awareness, enhancing communication for hazard detection /       avoidance, and devising targeted safety measures.         Safer and cleaner construction sites will also help elevate the image of the construction industry.  Gradually,       we are shedding the perception of “backwardness” associated with construction.  Recent success stories       have been very well received by the general public, notably the miraculous speed in which we have       completed the quarantine and medical facilities for Covid-19, as well as the jubilant opening of the MTR       Shatin - Central Line and the Tseung Kwan O – Lam Tin Tunnel and Cross Bay Link.  It is opportune for us       to tell more good stories about our efforts and rewards, and embark on publicity campaigns to attract the       young generation to bring in new blood and new ideas for driving further innovations.  To gear up the       industry for this welcoming change, additional funding of HK$1 billion has been injected to the Construction       Industry Council (CIC) for enhancing training efforts.  This, together with devotion of further resources for       training within CIC in collaborative training efforts by stakeholders, has raised training places of CIC for       skilled and semi-skilled workers from 5000 to 10,000 places for 2022/23.                                                                                   7","ICE Breaker 2023                                                  Messages          In the Construction Manpower Forecast for the coming five years just published by CIC, we are concerned       to note the widening gaps between demand and supply at the levels of professionals, technicians, site       supervisory personnel, and construction skilled workers.  Making reference to the forecast data, we are       assessing how to enhance the manpower supply through a multi-pronged strategy, including leveraging       local manpower resources, enhancing training and bringing in non-local resources as necessary, as well       as to reduce manpower needs through productivity uplifting measures.  Our target is to present the       assessment and a holistic strategy for addressing manpower needs of the construction sector by mid-2023.        An open and fair market is paramount for facilitating competition and incentivising innovation.  New       Engineering Contract (NEC) has become the default form of contract for sizeable public works projects,       having yielded evident success in time saving, budget control and productivity improvement.  We also see       the benefit of a “cost based” approach in preference to “price based” in contract procurement.  Looking       ahead, we will be exploring more on the use of target cost, early contractors involvement, and design-       and-build types of collaborative contracting arrangement.  The Security of Payment Legislation (SOPL)       is another important initiative that will come to fruition in the coming year to safeguard the rights of all       parties for proper and timely payment, for which we are very glad to see the industry’s overwhelming       support.        Combating climate change and achieving city resilience is another long term challenge calling for civil       engineers’ foresight and concerted actions.  We are working strenuously towards Hong Kong’s pledged       target of achieving carbon neutrality before 2050 with carbon emissions cut by 50% before 2035 as       compared to the 2005 level.  Energy efficiency and de-carbonization are embedded in our city planning       and design.  Comprehensive pedestrian and cycle track network, district cooling system, communal waste       separation and recycling are some examples of smart solutions to reduce carbon emission and improve       efficiency.  To enhance our city’s resilience and liveability, we are also actively pursuing strategic studies       and improvement works covering critical structure resilience, blue-green drainage infrastructure, and       shoreline management and improvement.        As civil engineers, we know only too well of the uncertainties associated with changes.  If we are more       certain and confident this time, it is because of the good work that we have done in weathering the storm       for the past years, and as a result, we are more clear where we are heading, we see our respective roles,       and we have the means to do it.

This year, we were very honoured to have Mr Wong Kam Sing, GBS, JP, Secretary for the Environment,       HKSAR Government; and Mr Ed McCann, President, Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) as our keynote       speakers. Mr Wong showed us the impacts of global warming and unprecedented extreme weather       with recent incidents in Hong Kong, e.g. Hato, 2017 and Mangkhut, 2018. He also introduced the       Hong Kong’s Climate Action Plan 2050 which brought together the overall strategies, plans, targets and       actions for Hong Kong to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050. Mr McCann, on the other hand, shared       his enlightenment on how increasing efficiency and productivity is the key to rising to the challenge       of tackling climate change. He also encouraged us, as engineers, to develop our skills in the use of       techniques and technology to collect and manage data, to communicate more effectively, to design and       plan optimally, and to manage our operations effectively, because effectiveness and efficiency within our       sector are key to both reducing carbon emissions and addressing the impact of climate change.

It is undeniable that everyone in the construction industry has been faced with a huge challenge in safety       performance in projects in recent years, and such pressure will be getting bigger and bigger in view of       the vast volume of projects in the coming decade. There is no perfect solution to ensure safety on site.       Instead, to make our construction site a great place to work relies concerted efforts from all stakeholders       from design to execution. On this premise, we have dedicated our coming annual conference to the said       theme.         The conference will commence with Mr Ricky Lau, JP, ICE Representative for Hong Kong and Permanent       Secretary for Development (Works) of the HKSAR Government, giving an opening address. Mr Michael       Fong, JP, Director of Civil Engineering and Development Department of the HKSAR Government, and       Mr Thomas Ho, Chairman of the Construction Industry Council, will respectively deliver the keynote       speeches. The Conference will have representatives from different backgrounds, including the clients,       consultants, contractors, academia, as well as the frontline. Speaker from Singapore will also share their       experience, and there will be discussion panels for deeper discussion on this important topic.

Held on 23 July 2022, the first discussion forum was titled ‘How to accelerate and mainstream       innovation to uplift construction productivity?’. Adopting and integrating new technologies as       well as the pursuit of innovation would have a positive impact on the Industry’s productivity levels.       This breakfast forum attracted 33 participants on the importance of adopting innovations to enhance       construction productivity and brainstorm the way forward.        It was honoured to have Mr Joseph Lo, Principal       Assistant Secretary of the Project Strategy and       Governance Office of the Development Bureau       to deliver an opening speech.  Mr Lo outlined the  4-2  current situation of the Hong Kong construction       industry, in the aspects of the forthcoming boost       in persistent demand for construction services,       the challenges arose from high construction costs       and ageing labour force, the need of uplifting       construction productivity, and the readiness of       adoption of innovations in Hong Kong.  After       the opening speech, an in-depth group and floor       discussions session were conducted on four major       aspects to uplift construction productivity in the       industry:           Topic 1 – Key obstacles and barriers encountered in practice for extensive application of innovative         solutions or ground - breaking ideas in uplifting construction productivity and project performance.          Topic 2 – Pain points in productivities for consultants and contractors.          Topic 3 – Lessons learnt from pilot trials in moving the Industry forward to accelerate and         mainstream innovation at scale, in either a revolutionary / disruptive manner or in an evolutionary         manner.          Topic 4 – Key areas that require re-engineering and restructuring for uplifting productivity apart         from innovative technologies and new materials / equipment.           12","ICE Breaker 2023                        Knowledge – Hong Kong Association          This discussion forum was considered fruitful that all participants have shared their experience in       pursuing/ adopting innovations, including the obstacles and barriers encountered in practice.  It       is hoped that these views would be useful for the successful implementation of the ambitious       infrastructure development plans for Hong Kong in future.       The second forum last year was on the topic of climate crisis. The increasing frequency of more       extreme weather is affecting people across the globe on a scale never seen before and Hong Kong       is by no means an exception. Titled ‘What should be our new flood prevention strategy       in response to the climate crisis?’, this breakfast forum on 10 December 2022 gathered 38       participants to discuss around the development of a comprehensive flood prevention strategy for Hong       Kong to address the increase in flood risk brought by climate change.        It was honoured to have Mr Louie Lau, Deputy       Head of Civil Engineering Office (Port \& Land)       of CEDD and Mr Edwin Lau, Assistant Director       (Operations \& Maintenance) of DSD to share their                                     4-1       relevant studies and proposals for Hong Kong’s       future flood prevention strategy in response to       the climate crisis.  After the sharing, an in - depth       group and floor discussion session on the following       four major aspects were carried out:           Topic 1 – Land use planning          Topic 2 – Engineering          Topic 3 – Cost effectives          Topic 4 – Sustainability/Environment        This discussion forum is considered fruitful. Mr Louie Lau and Mr Edwin Lau’s speeches and       subsequent discussions have enhanced the participants’ awareness towards climate risks and flooding       prevention strategy.  The participants have made some constructive suggestions on the formulation of       a comprehensive flood prevention strategy from land use planning, engineering, cost effectiveness and       sustainability perspectives.

The nullah was revitalized to       improve its riverside landscape from a concrete channel to a multi-functional channel with the elements       of sustainability and recreation.       The speaker, Mr Ronald Siu, commenced the visit with the revitalization considerations in the upstream       and downstream area. The original upstream area was steep with the speedy water flow. DSD optimised       the upstream area with 15 fish ladders（魚梯）and 15 shallow fords（淺灘）in a zigzag pattern. It       created a progressive area for fishes and slower the speed of water flow. The optimisation provides       a suitable environment for species of reptiles and freshwater fishes. Meanwhile, the original concrete       channel in the downstream area was revised with the implementation of ecological systems. The       planters alongside the sides of concrete channel were planted with eco - bags on top of the concrete       surface. The speaker stated that there were limited quantities of floral species that are available in Hong       Kong waters. As a result, DSD selected the suitable floral species to improve the riverside landscape       of the channel. The riverside landscape not only improved the environment of downstream area, but       attracts different species of butterflies and dragonflies which forms a comprehensive ecosystem on the       river.        Furthermore, a viewing platform was built on top of the cross area of the upstream and downstream       where the eco - friendly timber was applied. It is a recreational spot for the public on top of the channel.       More features were designed for interaction with the public which includes the “Selfie” spots and       sustainable standing area. These features further integrated the revitalised nullah into the riverside city.         It was a successful sharing in nullah revitalisation which contained the elements of sustainability and       recreation while the capacity against flooding was not affected.  6-3     6-1                                                             more photos    6-2                                                                          Overall event score: 7.75/10       14","ICE Breaker 2023                        Knowledge – Hong Kong Association          For female considering a career         in civil engineering         By Linda Hui        In selecting the career path, engineering   advancement.

The project team first introduced the treatment processes to be adopted in TKODP. Moreover, new       building technologies applied in this project were introduced, including the Design for Manufacture       and Assembly (DfMA) and the use of Building Information Model (BIM) to increase construction       efficiency. The use of BIM with Augmented Reality (AR) technology was also demonstrated. This       technology could increase the efficiency of site supervision by overlaying the BIM model on top of the       site environment on tablets. Site safety was also enhanced by the application of inspection underwater       drones equipped with AI cameras.        In this visit, the desalination plant was highlighted as an integral part of water demand management,       and various advanced construction technologies were introduced. This was truly a precious experience       for young professionals to learn more about the Total Water Management Strategy.

There were a total of 72 participants, with four candidates       and 68 observers. The workshop aims to familiarise candidates and observers with the actual       review format, gain technical knowledge, presentation, and interview skills from the experienced       facilitators.        Similar to the actual ICE CPR, each candidate was required to complete their professional       review submission prior to the workshop. The report would summarise their responsibilities and       experiences for each of the nine attributes which the candidate would be assessed on. Following       the presentations by the participants, the facilitators gave their comments on the performance of       the candidates. They also offered suggestions on the preparation and their presentations to help       them to improve on their presentation for the actual ICE CPR.

About 50 ICE fellows, who are all prestige leaders in the industry, showed up to network and get       the latest updates on the Institution. The reception began with the welcome remarks made by Mr       Ambrose Cheong, Vice-Chairman of ICE Hong Kong Association, followed by an opening speech by       Mr Ricky Lau, JP, ICE Representative for Hong Kong.        Mr Lau expressed his gratitude towards the important responsibility for continual development of the       civil engineering profession and upholding our values that our fellows had been shouldering. He then       called for our fellows to continue playing leading role in the professional development of the next       generation of civil engineers.                                                     “We shall also count on you as our                                                 role models for inspiring and nurturing                                                 our new generation, through sharing                                                 your knowledge and good deeds                                                 with young talents and students, and                                                 supporting those aspiring to follow our                                                 footsteps,” he said.       12a-3                                       Mr Lau also congratulated and welcomed                                              our new fellows. He said: “No doubt, your                                              achievement is the result of your dedication and                                              hard work.  Much of it, I am sure, is due to your                                              passion towards our civil engineering profession.

Janet       brings huge experience and insight from       a career with an extensive background in       infrastructure delivery.        She joins the ICE from the Cabinet Office       where she is head of the Government       Property Profession. She has also       been global director of estates for the       British Council, director of estates for       the Ministry of Justice, and head of       asset management in the Foreign and       Commonwealth Office.        A Major Projects Leadership Academy graduate of the Saïd Business School, Young is a fellow of       the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Her PhD, Towards Zero Energy Buildings, looked at the       challenges and solutions for low carbon and energy developments.             \"I join at a time when engineers and infrastructure professionals are making a real            impact in shaping a better world,\"                                                                said Dr Young             ICE President Keith Howells said: \"[Dr Young] brings exactly the skills we need as            the institution, and the wider profession, wrestles with the challenges of net zero, the            delivery of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the practical issues that            our industry faces on a day-to-day basis.\"            Young will take over from outgoing director general Nick Baveystock, who announced            in April that he will be leaving the Institution after a decade in the job.

Members are strongly advised to include these topics in the framework into their CPD planning and       highlight them within their Development Action Plan (DAP). Members should also indicate in the       Personal Development Record (PDR) how their CPD activities align to ICE CPD Framework topics.                 The topics will be updated every year and published on the ICE website. Click here             ice.org.uk/membership/ice-cpd-framework to view the CPD topics for 2022 and 2023.          Why has ICE introduced the framework?        The initial catalyst for introducing the framework was ICE's 2018 In Plain Sight report, which       recommended topics covering risk management and public safety in which civil engineers must       continue to demonstrate competency if they are to play their role in improving society.        However, safety is only one of our challenges as civil engineers so the framework is broadened to       include topics that cover contemporary themes such as digital transformation, decarbonisation and       productivity.        Who is the framework for?        The framework is aimed at professionally qualified       members, those holding a CEng, IEng or EngTech                                                                                           12c-1       qualification.       The topics may also be relevant to members from       other grades to address as part of their professional       development and the Professionalism Panel       encourages all members to consider the topics in the       framework when planning their CPD.                                                                                            39","ICE Breaker 2023
